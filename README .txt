NOTE: This project is in alpha phase and need to be reworked. 

This project was intended to make it easy for certain groups of students from Mathematical faculty to created HTML content without previous knowledge. 
One of goals was to created HTML content for creating online lessons. Unfortunately there was lacking communication and feedback from 3ed party to test and wrap up whole logic.
Most of project was done in vanila JS and it was alpha phase with most intended functionalites developed.
As it was one of my first project regarding software development intentions is in near future to do rework of code and gave it proper finish.
